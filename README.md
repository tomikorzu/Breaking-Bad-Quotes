## Objective

- Install dependencies in a project
- Make asynchronous calls to an API
- Manipulate the DOM using jQuery
- Store and retrieve information in LocalStorage

## Requirements

- Install jQuery in the project

## Description

Using the following API: [API], do the following:

- Create a responsive page containing a button that, when clicked, makes a call to the API and displays a quote from the Breaking Bad series.
- On page load, display a quote without needing to press the button.
- Add a button that, when clicked, saves the quote to LocalStorage.
- Add a button that allows deleting the quote from LocalStorage.
- On page reload, retrieve all saved quotes from LocalStorage and display them on the page.

### Bonus:

- Add a button to delete all saved quotes from LocalStorage.
- Search saved quotes using an input field.
- If the quote from the API is already saved in LocalStorage, fetch another quote.

### Notes:

- The API fetch should be done using jQuery.
- DOM manipulation should be done using jQuery.
